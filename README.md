### ABOUT
Waveform Viewer lets you view waveforms using the web! No weird fees, no needless features.

To begin, drag any file(s) to the drop-box pinned at the bottom of the screen, and voila! You can update the appearance of the waveform(s) live by using the sliders or color picker. 

### WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS ???

I am a graphic designer, and I had an edge case that required multiple waveforms for various songs. I couldn't really find any good free tools online, so I just decided to make, and share this! 

***WaveSurfer.js is doing all the hard work, I just made it easily accessible for those that are lazy like me...***
